<p>I want to be able publish posts easily to a statically served site.  I am sure that there are lots of blog site generators out there, but I could not find one that I liked, and which was in a language I would enjoy hacking, and so I wrote my own.</p>

<p>The blog site is generated from file based posts, using an augmented version of xhtml as the input format. The input format has a DTD, as well as a Relax NG compressed schema generated using <a href="http://www.thaiopensource.com/relaxng/trang.html">Trang</a> which is used in the provided schemas.xml file to allow validation in Emacs <a href="http://www.thaiopensource.com/nxml-mode/">nXML mode</a>.</p>

<p>When ready, the drafts are merged into a post template, in standard xhtml, to produce a site that can be rsync'd to a web host.  The merging of the templates is done using <a href="http://www.sbcl.org/">SBCL</a> and <a href="http://common-lisp.net/project/cxml/">CXML</a>.  The generator maintains a database of posts, so that it can generate the index page, etc, and uses <a href="http://common-lisp.net/project/elephant/">Elephant</a>.  The whole site can be re-generated from the input post files, so a revision control system, such as git, can be used to manage the posts, and we don't have to worry about backing up the the database too frequently.</p>

<p>An Emacs minor-mode can be used to trigger the publishing and site generation.</p>

<p>The generator is intended to produce a personol blog, with one user.  I am however misusing it here to provide a sort of update blog for the software itself.</p>
