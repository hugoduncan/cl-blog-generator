Blog generator in CL

A blog is not really dynamic content, and so should be served as static, which means we can use a generator.

drafts - contains our input
published - contains published drafts
site - contains processed version of the published articles

We use a database for the metadata.

We expect to be editting content in emacs


We use the blog in content as a way of documenting progress :-)
